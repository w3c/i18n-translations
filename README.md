# i18n-translations
Tracks translation jobs in progress for w3.org/International pages.

Translators wishing to translate an Internationalization Activity article or page should:
1. read the instructions at https://www.w3.org/International/i18n-drafts/pages/translation.html
2. raise an issue in this repository, indicating (a) that they agree to the conditions described in the instructions page, and (b) requesting the go-ahead to translate a particular page or pages (please provide URLs)

**Do not begin translating before getting a reply!**  There are a number of reasons why you might be wasting your time, if you start without that.  The W3C staff will ensure that the template used for the page(s) in question is up to date before you start.
